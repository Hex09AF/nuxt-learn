# 1. [ ] Auth, Session

## 1.1 Session

_HTTP is a stateless_ protocol which means that each request made from the client to the server is treated as a standalone request; neither the client nor the server keeps track of the subsequent requests. Sessions allow you to change that; with sessions, the server has a way to associate some information with the client so that when the same client requests the server, it can retrieve that information.
